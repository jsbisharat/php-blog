# php-blog
- This project is about building a blog system using php and arrays. 

- It utilizes a pagination system depending on how many pages the user would like to display. 

- It also depends on the user if they would like their blog to display in descending or ascending date order. 

Steps to create your blog system
1. Set up your .htaccess file with the rules to display clean url's 
2. Set up your array of blogs within the blog.php file
3. Type into blog-check.php if you would like the blogs to appear in ascending (newer blogs -> older blogs) or descending (older blogs -> newer blogs). 
    a. This is because the factor is based on the publication date the user published the blog.
